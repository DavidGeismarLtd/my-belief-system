## Quick Reference

### Product Vision (One-Liner)

> First Principles helps you understand how political actors align with your values — and how that alignment changes over time — beyond rhetoric, headlines, and short-term memory.

### Core Value Proposition

**For users:** "I want to know which political actors actually align with my values — not just today, but over time, and beyond rhetoric."

**What we provide:**
- A clear, explicit portrait of their own value system
- A living comparison between that value system and political actors
- Visibility into drift, contradictions, and convergence as they happen

### What Makes This Different

| Compared to | First Principles Difference |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Political quizzes | Values are explicit, weighted, and revisable; alignment is ongoing, not one-off |
| News/analysis | Focuses on principles, not events; maintains long-term memory; makes change visible |
| Partisan tools | Same framework applied to all actors; uncertainty surfaced; no pay-to-influence |

### Core Design Principles

1. **Neutral, calm tone** - No partisan framing
2. **No score obsession** - Alignment is nuanced, not gamified
3. **Explain before judging** - Context and reasoning always visible
4. **Uncertainty is a feature** - Ambiguity is surfaced, not hidden
5. **Long-term memory** - Track changes over time, not just snapshots

### Product Boundaries (What We DON'T Do)

- ❌ No voting recommendations
- ❌ No "best match" gamification
- ❌ No moral judgments
- ❌ No outrage-driven alerts
- ❌ No news aggregation
- ❌ No social features or sharing
- ❌ No pay-to-influence mechanics
