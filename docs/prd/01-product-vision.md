# Product Vision & Mission

## Vision Statement

First Principles creates a new category of political tool: **a personal value compass that provides clarity, coherence, and long-term memory in political decision-making.**

We believe that most people don't lack political values — they lack a stable, inspectable framework for understanding how those values map to the constantly shifting landscape of political actors and rhetoric.

## Mission

To help individuals:
1. **Understand their own political values** with clarity and precision
2. **Track political actors** at the level of principles, not soundbites
3. **Maintain political memory** across election cycles and news cycles
4. **Make informed decisions** based on alignment with their core beliefs

## Problem Statement

### Current State

Political decision-making today relies on:
- **Gut feeling** - Intuitive but inconsistent and easily manipulated
- **Selective memory** - We remember what confirms our biases
- **Media narratives** - Framed by others' agendas, focused on conflict and novelty
- **Tribal affiliation** - Party loyalty that may not reflect actual value alignment
- **Snapshot judgments** - Based on recent events, not long-term patterns

### Pain Points

1. **Value ambiguity**: People often can't articulate *why* they support or oppose a political actor
2. **Rhetorical confusion**: Politicians say one thing, do another; hard to track consistency
3. **Memory failure**: Political positions shift over time, but we forget the history
4. **Information overload**: Too much news, not enough signal
5. **False binaries**: Forced into "left vs right" when values are multidimensional
6. **Alignment drift**: A party you once aligned with may have changed, or you may have changed

### Desired State

Users should be able to:
- See their own value system as a clear, structured model
- Compare that model to political actors using the same framework
- Track how alignment changes over time
- Understand *why* alignment exists or doesn't exist
- Make decisions based on principles, not personalities or tribes

## Core Principles

### 1. Neutrality Over Persuasion

**Principle**: The product never tells users who to support. It provides a framework for understanding alignment.

**Implications**:
- No "recommended candidates"
- No moral framing (e.g., "good" vs "bad" values)
- Same analytical framework applied to all political actors
- User's value system is the reference point, not an external standard

### 2. Clarity Over Simplicity

**Principle**: Politics is complex. We make complexity inspectable, not hidden.

**Implications**:
- Show uncertainty and confidence levels
- Explain how conclusions were reached
- Allow users to drill down into evidence
- Don't reduce multidimensional alignment to a single score

### 3. Memory Over Novelty

**Principle**: Long-term patterns matter more than recent headlines.

**Implications**:
- Track changes over months and years, not just days
- Highlight drift and reversals
- Maintain historical context
- Don't prioritize "breaking news" over sustained positions

### 4. Principles Over Personalities

**Principle**: Focus on what actors *stand for*, not who they are.

**Implications**:
- Model values, not character traits
- Track actions and stated positions, not personal drama
- Compare on policy substance, not rhetoric style
- Avoid celebrity/personality framing

### 5. Transparency Over Black Boxes

**Principle**: Users should understand how the system works.

**Implications**:
- Explain value modeling methodology
- Show what data sources inform actor profiles
- Make algorithms inspectable (at appropriate level of detail)
- Allow users to correct or refine their value portrait

## Success Vision

### 6 Months

### 3 Years

- Users make voting decisions informed by long-term alignment data
- Political actors are aware they're being tracked on principle, not just rhetoric
- The product has measurably reduced "tribal" voting in favor of value-aligned voting

## Non-Goals

What this product is **NOT**:

1. **Not a news aggregator** - We don't surface breaking political news
2. **Not a social network** - No sharing, commenting, or community features
3. **Not a prediction market** - We don't forecast election outcomes
4. **Not a fact-checker** - We track positions, not truth claims
5. **Not a campaign tool** - No features for political organizing or activism
6. **Not a recommendation engine** - We don't tell you who to vote for
7. **Not a debate platform** - No user-generated content or discussions

## Target Outcomes

### For Users
- **Clarity**: "I understand my own political values better"
- **Confidence**: "I know why I support or don't support this actor"
- **Consistency**: "I can track whether actors stay aligned with my values"
- **Calm**: "I feel less reactive to political news"

### For the Product
- **Trust**: Users believe the analysis is fair and unbiased
- **Retention**: Users return regularly to check alignment updates
- **Depth**: Users engage with detailed explanations, not just top-line scores
- **Advocacy**: Users recommend the product as "the tool that helped me understand politics"

## Positioning

Instead of relying on gut feeling or media narratives, you get a clear, structured view of your own political values and how they map to parties and politicians. It's like a political compass, but one that tracks changes over months and years, not just a snapshot."
